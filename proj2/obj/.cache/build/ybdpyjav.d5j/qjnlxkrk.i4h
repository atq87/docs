<li>Added warning when build-only assets cannot be located</li>
<li>Improved validation reporting in Metadata model dynamic objects</li>
<li>Added an error for duplicate dataflow column nodes.  This usually arises with &quot;reserved&quot; column names &quot;ErrorCode&quot; and &quot;ErrorText&quot;</li>

<li>Fixed a few minor Teradata type mapping issues</li>
<li>Fixed Oracle datatype mapping in decimals</li>
<li>Significantly improved DatabaseProviderSelector to more closely match Mist 3.4.  Most notably, this will fix issues where ADO.NET connections were largely ignoring the provider setting</li>

<li>Fixed minor issue with emission of corrupt packages when using PDW with a 2008 target</li>
<li>Fixed issue with DataType emission in downlevel SSIS targets</li>

<li>Added option to automatically add a Biml annotation to imported SSIS object to indicate their source package</li>
<li>Added option to add annotations to destination components with unmapped external columns</li>
<li>Added feature where duplicate items in SSIS import are renamed, but a Biml annotation is added with the original name</li>
