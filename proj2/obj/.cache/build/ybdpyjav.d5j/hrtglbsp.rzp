<h4 id="significant-changes-between-mist-40-update-1-and-bimlstudio-2017">Significant changes between Mist 4.0 Update 1 and BimlStudio 2017</h4>
<p><strong>Breaking Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moved PathAnnotation from PrecedenceConstraints to TaskflowInputPath.</li>
<li>Clean output folder is now set to false by default in AstEngine&#39;s compiler settings.</li>
<li>Fixed issue in CallBimlScript property directives where all properties were required and marking them as required would create an error. To fix this, we apply all of the required properties first and then the optional properties in order of specification. Since required properties basically didn&#39;t work before, this shouldn&#39;t affect any actual code, but it should be called out as a potentially significant behavioral change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BimlStudio Rebranding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated version to BimlStudio 2017 v5.0.</li>
<li>Updated splash screens, logos, and color scheme to match Biml color scheme.</li>
<li>Removed all instances of the text &quot;Mist&quot; from the product and all code. If you were using any unsupported Mist APIs, replace all instances of &quot;Mist&quot; with &quot;BimlStudio&quot;.</li>
<li>Updated BimlStudio version to 5.0 in the Registry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Biml global includes</li>
<li>Biml Bundles</li>
<li>New source control UI including Git, Visual Studio Online, and Team Explorer Everywhere support</li>
<li>Significant performance improvements</li>
<li>New installer</li>
<li>SSIS 2016 support</li>
<li>SSAS Tabular Emission</li>
<li>Usability enhancements throughout the UI</li>
<li>Added multi-product support to license keys and better offline support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Platform</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moved all DLLs and executables to use .NET 4.6 rather than .NET 3.5.</li>
<li>Removed warnings from a couple of framework transformers.</li>
<li>BimlStudio is now truly x86 or x64. This shouldn&#39;t be visible to end-users, but it was necessary to begin hosting HTML/JS/CSS controls natively in BimlStudio. The command line compiler is unaffected and remains AnyCPU.</li>
<li>Updated EULA to cover frameworks including BimlFlex.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Biml Bundles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>User Interface</li>

<li>Manifests</li>
<li>Added icon support for EP categories in bundles.</li>
<li>Added new file template support in bundles for Eps.</li>
