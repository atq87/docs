<p><strong>BREAKING CHANGES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RootNode.PackageProjects has now moved entirely into RootNode.Projects, including all namespaces.  This is done to better support other project types such as analysis services projects.  The mitigation is to change all instances of the <packageprojects> tag to the <projects> tag.<ul>
<li>MITIGATION: If backwards compatibility with older versions of Mist is required, the PackageProjects/Projects element name can be conditionalized based on the tools version.</li>
</ul>
</projects></packageprojects></li>
<li>Removed QuerySource and Destination.  These were abstractions that wrapped OleDbSource/AdoNetSource and OleDbDestination/AdoNetDestination in a single interface that offered the intersection of their features and automatically chose the correct component type to emit based on the referenced connection type.  These language elements were not particularly useful, were very narrowly used, and their removal will prevent unintentional use by new customers.<ul>
<li>MITIGATION: Change any instances of QuerySource or Destination to the appropriate OleDbSource/AdoNetSource and OleDbDestination/AdoNetDestination</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All instances of the word Hadron have been removed from the project.  Practical implications include:<ul>
<li>Hadron.exe is now bimlc.exe</li>
<li>Namespaces that included &quot;Hadron&quot; have 1:1 replacements with &quot;Biml&quot;</li>
<li>MITIGATION: Empty classes were added in the removed namespaces to prevent code with legacy namespace imports from breaking scripts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AstDimensionNode and AstFactNode have been removed.  SSAS metadata is now added underneath the AnalysisMetadata element of table objects</li>
<li>AnalysisServices connection property OverriddenConnectionString is renamed to ConnectionString.  The Provider property is removed as it is no longer needed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Build Configurations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Transformer frameworks are now much easier to use.  FrameworkSettings within a Mist project can now be selected from a dropdown in the Build Configuration (bimlproj) editor</li>
<li>Auto-generated and default build configuration files now use $(MSBuildPath) instead of hardcoded absolute paths, which makes the files more portable among multiple developers</li>
<li>Changed target version defaults to 2012 (from 2008) in command line compiler and MSBuild task</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General UI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed Mist theme to have a more modern look and feel</li>
<li>True MDI.  In previous versions of Mist, only a single asset could be opened for editing at a time.  In Mist 4.0, as many editor windows can be opened as system memory permits.</li>
<li>All dialog boxes have been updated to use modern styling</li>
<li>Save project dialog includes a list of all changed files</li>
<li>Multiselect delete from logical view will now show just one confirmation dialog</li>
<li>Added New Item Dialog for creating items in Logical View library or Project View</li>
<li>The ability to zoom in/out has been added to every editor and tool window in Mist.  Zoom levels can be set via the zoom slider in the status bar or by holding the control key and scrolling the mouse wheel.  The zoom level can be reset by pressing control + 0 or by pressing control and clicking the mouse wheel</li>
<li>Updated Getting started items on start page</li>
<li>Small fix to Mist status bar to hide line and column info when not relevant</li>
<li>Added notifications window as a central repository of all Mist notifications</li>
<li>Added code to more aggressively terminate background threads for faster Mist process termination</li>
<li>Fixed Biml utility file expansion so that it will also work if there is no BimlScript nuggets in a file</li>
<li>Improved JumpList handling so that it matches what is shown in Mist recent and pinned items lists</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ribbon</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ribbon layout has been improved - especially in Home ribbon</li>
<li>Refresh and Refresh All buttons for BimlScripts have been added to the Build ribbon, in addition to a Refresh option on context menus for Biml files and logical view assets.  This is particularly useful when external metadata has been changed and BimlScripts need to be re-executed</li>
<li>A toggle button has been added to the Build ribbon to enable/disable the background processing of live BimlScripts.  This is useful in cases where a large number of changes need to be made to scripts that have long execution times</li>
<li>Added file addition to ribbon</li>
<li>Added UI and persistence support for Framework file selection in Project View and Config files.  Still need to add MSBuild pieces</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Logical View</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added LogicalDisplayFolder property to all Biml root objects and library files</li>
<li>Modified logical view to have groupings by Relational, SSIS, SSAS, Metadata, Library, Broken Live BimlScripts</li>
<li>Added ability to convert to files from live Logical ViewReference biml script from Live</li>
<li>Added ability to view common database file types in the Logical View library</li>
<li>Added support for icon change when an object is stale from broken live BimlScript.  This still isn&#39;t working for subclasses of child items of root nodes</li>
<li>Fixed issue where broken live BimlScript wouldn&#39;t show up in cases of schema binding overrides of root collections</li>
<li>Added hierarchical filtering to logical view</li>
<li>Added support for saving LogicalDisplayFolder that is set on file view models</li>
<li>Added feature for default logical view open behavior override</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Table Import</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Table import is now much faster - up to 500X in some cases</li>
<li>Table import UI is simplified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other File Types</strong></p>

<li>Teradata Destination</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added SSIS Path Annotations to dataflow and control flow paths</li>
<li>Added support to SSIS emitter for emitting external columns without the corresponding output columns.  This is primarily used for database datatypes that are unsupported by SSIS.</li>
<li>Changed DbType to DataType in column specifications</li>

<li>Added PackagePassword property to AstPackageNode for encryption support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SSAS Emission</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Project View</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Better handling of files that are referenced from project file but don&#39;t exist on disk</li>
<li>Prevented renaming of files to include invalid filename characters</li>
<li>Prevented background change notifications from occurring when a file is not part of the project but is visible via the &quot;Show All Files&quot; Project View option.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>ScriptProject<ul>
<li>Fixed the expanded rendering of script projects within the logical view</li>
<li>Fixed issue where BimlScript generated script projects would have a growing list of blank files in the autogenerated collection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Table<ul>
<li>Added analysis metadata management to the core table designer with support for multiple analysis metadata objects on the same table.New approach to analysis metadata</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Package Editor<ul>
<li>Fixed a crashing issue when trying to drag from a dataflow edge to a node</li>
<li>Fixed issue where clicking on package design surface would not de-select the selected node (which prevented switching focus back to the node)</li>
<li>Added a link to quickly open the Package Toolbox when the package design surface is empty</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Designers synchronizing with Biml code<ul>
<li>Empty parent tags are now converted to self-closing when emptying a child collection or nulling a singleton child</li>
<li>Fixed XML emission of singleton children that have existing elements (usually because the object has properties set before it is added to the parent collection)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Licensing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix for issue where Mist would crash when entering an offline product key if a product key had never been previously entered.</li>
<li>Fixed a spelling error on the license key page.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Mist can sometime crash when it has a license key that cannot be deserialized due to invalid UserData content</li>
<li>Added ability to get machine code in account control</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Biml Language</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Directives<ul>
<li>Added designerbimlpath to the template directive so that intelliprompt can be provided correctly on Biml fragments (that are later included or called)</li>
<li>Added code directive to reference C# or VB files with code directly from Biml files.  This enables a variety of scenarios around creating more complex and reusable .NET code for use within BimlScripts</li>
<li>Nested include files now work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other<ul>
<li>Added ObjectTag property to all Biml API classes.  This is essentially a .NET Dictionaryt object that enables storage of .NET objects in a similar way to annotations in Biml.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Biml Code Editor</strong></p>

<li>Fixed the issue where the quick info for the xmlns attribute of the Biml element would show as invalid</li>
<li>Added intelliprompt for files referenced by code directives</li>
<li>Added Find All shortcut binding to Ctrl-Shift-F</li>
<li>Added pre-population of find terms with selected text and auto selection of find terms</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>BimlScript Errors/Warnings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with ValidationReporter where it would occasionally report line numbers into our temp files.  This usually happened with mismatched end braces</li>
<li>Improved validator for SSIS data flow columns to show the duplicate column name when the same column is mapped multiple times</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where transformer generated errors were not being reported correctly.  They previously appeared as Null Reference Exceptions because of an issue in the reporting mechanism.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where wrong column name was being shown in Script Component column type mismatch errors</li>
<li>Clarified error message when &quot;Build and Run&quot; or &quot;Build and Execute&quot; was performed without the correct version of SSIS installed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed spacing in table column documentation</li>
