##### Cube Editor

Use the cube editor to create and modify cube dimension and measure groups, along with dimension relationships between cube dimensions and measure groups.

![Cube Designer](https://varigencecom.blob.core.windows.net/images-mistdocumentation-editoroverviews/Cube1.png)

Input a measure group's name and associated fact table in the measure group's 
data grid row.

![Cube Measure Groups](https://varigencecom.blob.core.windows.net/images-mistdocumentation-editoroverviews/Cube2.png)

Select a measure group to choose its associated measures, and view and edit it's dimension relationships. Enter a dimension relationship's properties directly in its data grid row.

![Cube Measure Group Measures](https://varigencecom.blob.core.windows.net/images-mistdocumentation-editoroverviews/Cube3.png)

Enter a cube dimension's name and associated project dimension in the cube dimension's data grid row.

Button | Description
--- | ---
Measure Group | Add a measure group to the cube.
Dimension Relationship | Choose and add a dimension, dimension reference, or many to many relationship to a selected measure group.
Dimension | Add a dimension to the cube.
Infer Cube Dimensions | Generate cube dimensions and dimension relationships from project dimensions and measure groups.
Infer Measure Groups | Generate measure groups from project fact tables.
Ensure Dimension References | In each cube dimension, add references to its associated project dimension's attributes and hierarchies.
Ensure Measure Group References | In each measure group, add references to its associated fact table's measures.
