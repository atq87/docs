## BimlStudio User Guide

The BimlStudio User Guide describes all aspects of the BimlStudio user interface.

The BimlStudio User Guide is broken up into three parts. The first part provides a step by step walkthrough for building assets for use in a sample cube, leveraging the AdventureWorksLT database. The second part describes each BimlStudio editor, tool window, and ribbon button. The third part includes miscellaneous topics that don't fit into the first two groups.

## BimlStudio Forum
