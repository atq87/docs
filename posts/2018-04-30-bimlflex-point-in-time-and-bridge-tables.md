# BimlFlex - Point In Time and Bridge Tables

This BimlFlex video looks at creating Point In Time and Bridge Tables in BimlFlex.

The video starts with a short overview of the Data Vault Point In Time and Bridge constructs.
This highlights that the Point In Time construct is used as a query helper and optimization for managing timelines across multiple changes for multiple satellites attached to the same Hub or Link. The Bridge construct is used as a query helper and optimization for managing relationships across multiple Hubs and Links.
