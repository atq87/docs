# BimlFlex - Agile Data Vault Acceleration

Implementing a Data Vault project may seem daunting for many of you. However, if you break it down into smaller, more agile deliverables, it is quite achievable.

Agile is about creating business value through the early and frequent delivery of integrated data while responding to change. BimlFlex accommodates Agile's emphasis on collaboration and incremental development by introducing Model Groupings to our Data Vault Accelerator.

In this short webinar, we demonstrate how you can use the new `ModelGroup` attribute to accelerate in-scope sections of your model.
