# SSIS Tasks

Biml includes support for all current SSIS tasks, but with a simpler interface and the ability to reuse defined assets across numerous tasks and packages. You can also combine task tags with BimlScript to generate components and tasks based on project metadata.

Keep an eye out for advanced features that simplify common behaviors such as Merge, IsNullPatcher, and the ExternalFile property on the Execute SQL task.
