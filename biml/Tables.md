<p>
Tables in Biml allow you to define your cube's entire relational schema. Besides 
including support for common table elements, such as columns, keys, and indexes, 
and table types, Biml adds several unique capabilities to tables.</p>
<p>
Biml tables can have custom extensions, that execute SSIS tasks after table 
creation. Additionally, static sources let you specify starter data to fill into 
a table after creation. Biml also includes a clone table, which lets you specify 
a baseline table to be copied. The copied table can include or exclude the 
baseline table's keys, indexes, or columns, as well as add its own. Clone tables 
come in handy for staging and temporary storage.</p>
