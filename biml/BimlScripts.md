Biml is our XML based language for modeling a BI solution. BimlScript allows you 
to embed C# or VB.NET code into Biml, in the same way that ASP.NET works with 
HTML. </p>
<p>
The BimlScript snippets demonstrate scenarios where BimlScript can solve 
otherwise cumbersome tasks. To aid in writing your own BimlScripts, check out 
the <a href="http://www.varigence.com/documentation/biml/api.html">Biml API 
reference</a>, which documents every property, method, and event available to 
each .NET class.</p>
