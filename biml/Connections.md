<p>Biml replaces connection managers with named connection objects that can be referenced by other elements. This enables easy reuse. Furthermore, if a connection needs to change, you only 
need to change it in one place.</p>
<p>Biml includes connection objects for standard connection types, including ADO.NET, Excel, FTP, HTTP, MSMQ, OLE DB, WMI, and others.</p>
