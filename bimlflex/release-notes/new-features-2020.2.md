# New Features in BimlFlex 2020.2 Update

## Breaking Changes

Upon updating to BimlFlex version 2020.2, users will be required to initiate a one-time manual update to the Excel Metadata Editor add-in.
Microsoft Excel has hardcoded the path to the add-in, and unfortunately, there is no preprogrammed workaround.

Documentation providing a step-by-step walkthrough for this process can be found [here](xref:excel-metadata-addin)
