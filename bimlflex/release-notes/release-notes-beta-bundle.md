# Beta Bundle Release Notes

The Beta Bundle channel is available as an option in the Upgrade Assets Bundle in BimlStudio 2018 R3 and later. Use this to test new features and hot fixes before they are included in public Bundle updates.

> [!NOTE]
> Beta releases are potentially unstable, please make sure you have a backup of your database and projects prior to upgrading or applying any updates. We also recommend that your project and bundles are checked into your source control.
> Please email bimlflex-support@varigence.com should you experience any issues while upgrading.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Beta Bundle channel allows users to test new features and bug fixes. Only apply the beta channel updates in a separate development testing environment. It is not possible to downgrade a database from a Beta version to a stable release version.
