Azure Data Factory, the Microsoft cloud service built for complex ETL, ELT, and data integration projects, has become a flagship Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for contemporary data engineers due to its powerful systems that provide comprehensive end-to-end services, data-driven workflows, and scale data transformation processes. BimlFlex, the premiere Data Warehouse Automation (DWA) service from Varigence, seeks to continue to regularly implement, improve, and deploy new features that integrate seamlessly with the dominant presence of Azure Data Factory. The combination of Azure Data Factory's powerful cloud-based platform with the flexible and customizable framework provided by BimlFlex will enable your organization to expedite warehouse development, increase development productivity, and proactively adapt to changing business insights, without ever having to write a single line of code.

## New Features in BimlFlex 2020 R2

In the upcoming BimlFlex 2020 R2 Rollout, users can expect the following new features and relationships which highlight the synergy between BimlStudio, BimlFlex, and Azure Data Factory:

* Flat file source and dataset support
* Support for dataflow
* Ability to specify schema on dataset
* Ability to specify additional columns collections for Copy activities
* Added support for new activities
* Added support for new connectors and connections

## Flat File Source and Dataset Support

BimlFlex has added support for Azure Data Factory's ability to use flat files in datasets and sources for Copy activities, regardless of whether the data is stored on premises or in the cloud.

## Support for Dataflow

Mapping dataflows is a visual depiction of data transformations, allowing users to develop data transformation logic without having to write any code. BimlFlex has been optimized to support Azure Data Factory's data flows, including code translation, path optimization, and execution of routine data flow tasks.

## Ability to Specify Schema on Dataset

BimlFlex and Azure Data Factory now enable users to specify schema on a dataset. When copying data from a source, users may specify explicit schema mapping, allowing the ability to customize mappings based on the needs of your organization. BimlFlex can now harness the power to create more efficient copies between sources and sinks.

## Ability to Specify Additional Columns Collections for Copy Activities

Now featured is the ability to specify additional columns within specific sources in Copy activities.
Traditionally if users desired a specific column in the sink but it did not exist in the source, there was little recourse. Now, BimlFlex and Azure Data Factory allow users to add additional columns by using expression driven values that are calculated within the current context and appending them to the source dataset.

## Added Support for New Activities

New activities are supported between BimlFlex and Azure Data Factory, including:

* Switch activity
* MLexecutePipeline activity
* Executedataflow activity

## Added Support for New Connectors and Connections

BimlFlex has incorporated support for many new connectors, simplifying settings for users when connecting disparate data locations as a data source. BimlFlex 2020 R2 has added support for the following connectors:

* Google Cloud Storage
* Azure File Storage
* Azure ML Service
* Azure Maria Db
* Snowflake
* Share Point Online List

## BimlFlex 2020 R2 Release

Users can expect the BimlFlex 2020 R2 update to roll out in Q3 2020, and can expect overwhelming parity between BimlStudio, BimlFlex, and new features implemented within recent Azure Data Factory updates.
