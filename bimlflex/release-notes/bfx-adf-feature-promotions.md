# BimlExpress 2020 and Azure Data Factory Featured Integrations

Azure Data Factory, the Microsoft cloud service built for complex ETL, ELT, and data integration projects, has become a flagship Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for contemporary data engineers due to its powerful systems that provide comprehensive end-to-end services, data-driven workflows, and scale data transformation processes. BimlFlex, the premiere Data Warehouse Automation (DWA) service from Varigence, seeks to continue to regularly implement, improve, and deploy new features that integrate seamlessly with the dominant presence of Azure Data Factory. The combination ADF's powerful cloud-based platform with the flexible and customizable framework provided by BimlFlex will enable your organization to expedite warehouse development, increase development productivity, and proactively adapt to changing business insights, without ever having to write a single line of code.

## New Features in BimlFlex 2020 R2

In the upcoming BimlFlex 2020 R2 Rollout, users can expect the following new features and relationships which highlight the synergy between BimlStudio, BimlFlex, and Azure Data Factory:

* Flat File source and dataset support
* Support for dataflow
* Ability to specify schema on dataset
* Ability to specify additional columns collections for copy activities
* Added support for new activities
* Added support for new connectors and connections

## Flat File Source and Dataset Support

BimlFlex has added support for Azure Data Factory's ability to use Flat Files as either a source or as dataset support, and supports for Copy activity for data stored on-premises and/or in the cloud.

## Support for Dataflow

Mapping dataflows is a visual depiction of data transformations, allowing users to develop data transformation logic without having to write any code. BimlExpress 2020 R1 has been optimized to support Azure Data Factory's data flows, including code translation, path optimization, and execution of routine data flow tasks.

## Ability to Specify Schema on Dataset

BimlExpress 2020 and Azure Data Factory now allow users to specific schema on a dataset. When copying data from a source, users may specify explicit schema mapping, allowing the ability to customize mappings based on the needs of your organization and dataset.

## Ability Specify Additional Columns Collections for Copy Activities

Now featured is the ability to specify additional columns upon collection of specific sources in Copy activities.
Traditionally if users desired a specific column in the destination but it did not exist in the source, there was little recourse to transform that data. BimlExpress and Azure Data Factory allow users to add additional column(s) by putting the value as a data driven expression that will calculate it in its current context and add the column(s) to the destination.

## Added Support for New Activities

New activities are supported between BimlFlex and Azure Data Factory, including: `switch activity` `MLexecutePipeline Activity` and `executedataflow` activities.

## Added Support for New Connectors and Connections

BimlFlex has incorporated support for many new connectors, allowing for simplified settings when connecting disparate data locations as a data source. BimlFlex 2020 R2 has added support for the following connectors:

* Google Cloud Storage
* Azure File Storage
* Azure ML Service
* Azure Maria Db
* Snowflake
* Share Point Online List

## BimlFlex 2020 R2 Release

Users can expect the BimlFlex 2020 R2 update to roll out in Q3 2020, and can expect overwhelming parity with BimlFlex and new features implemented within recent Azure Data Factory updates.
