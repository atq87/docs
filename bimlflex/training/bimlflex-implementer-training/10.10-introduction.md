# What is BimlFlex?

BimlFlex is a collection of templates, metadata definitions, and tooling that enables you to build an end-to-end data solution without ever writing a single line of code.

It is built on BimlStudio and uses the Biml language for extensions and bespoke code.

The BimlFlex workflow allows a modeler to organize metadata to fit business requirements and a developer to implement the solution using databases, SSIS packages and SQL artefacts

# The BimlFlex development experience

## BimlStudio

BimlFlex is built on BimlStudio, the development environment for Biml.  
It is a Visual Studio-like development environment that can build and generate SSIS Packages for ETL and SQL scripts for DDL and ELT

## SQL DDL script for tables

```sql
USE [BFX_STG]
GO
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.schemas WHERE name = N'AWLT')
EXEC ('CREATE SCHEMA [AWLT] AUTHORIZATION [dbo]')
GO
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * from sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'AWLT') AND type IN (N'U'))
CREATE TABLE [AWLT].[Address]
(
-- Columns Definition (abridged)
     [Address_BK] nvarchar(100) NOT NULL
,    [AddressID] int NOT NULL
,    [FlexRowEffectiveFromDate] datetime2(7) NOT NULL
,    [FlexRowAuditId] bigint NOT NULL
-- Constraints
,CONSTRAINT [PK_AWLT_Address] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED
(
  [Address_BK] Asc, [FlexRowEffectiveFromDate] ASC)
  WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF,IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF) ON "default"
)
ON "default"
WITH (DATA_COMPRESSION = PAGE)
GO
```

# Sample results

## SQL Stored Procedure, PIT Load Process

```sql
CREATE PROC [rdv].[flex_PIT_Product]
    /* Placeholder for Initialize extensionpoint="RdvPitSql" (CustomOutput.RdvPitAddParameter) */
AS
SET NOCOUNT ON
DECLARE @Lag INT = -1
DECLARE @FlexRowEffectiveFromDate DATETIME2(7) = ISNULL((
            SELECT   DATEADD(DD, @Lag, MAX([FlexRowEffectiveFromDate]))
            FROM    [rdv].[PIT_Product]
            /* Do not reload the initial load. To reload the PIT it must be truncated */
            WHERE    [FlexRowEffectiveFromDate] > ISNULL((
                        SELECT   MIN([FlexRowEffectiveFromDate])
                        FROM     [rdv].[PIT_Product]
                        WHERE    [FlexRowEffectiveFromDate] > '0001-01-01 00:00:00.000'
                        ), '0001-01-01 00:00:00.000')
            /* Placeholder for Initialize extensionpoint="RdvPitSql" (CustomOutput.RdvPitDateWhereSql) */
```
