# BimlOnline Retirement Scheduled for Dec 31, 2020

November 6, 2020

Three years ago, Varigence launched an experimental development tool called BimlOnline.
Running entirely within a browser with no required software to install, the tool provided advanced Biml code editing capabilities for Biml XML elements, in addition to C# and VB BimlScript code nuggets.
This required substantial server software infrastructure to provide real-time code analysis and a high-speed mechanism for synchronizing code changes and editing UI.
The Biml engine underwent a major refactoring in order to run in a client server architectural context.
This refactoring provided a variety of ancillary benefits to all Biml tooling, such as improved build performance and reduced memory overhead.
Our team also built a browser extension to enable on-premises schema, and other metadata, to be seamlessly supplied to the Biml engine at the user’s request.

While BimlOnline was among the most innovative browser-hosted integrated development environments (IDE) when it launched, it became clear over time that the user model wasn’t quite right.
Oftentimes, when new technologies become available, the first impulse is to translate what already works directly into the new way of doing things.
For instance, when television was first developed, directors would place a single fixed camera in the middle of a live studio audience so that viewers at home had “the best seat in the house.”
Over time, the potential for entirely new story telling methods were realized using cuts from multiple cameras with different vantage points.

BimlOnline, though an impressive technical achievement, ultimately was a direct reimagining of a traditional IDE running in a browser – the best seat in the house for developers who wanted an IDE but didn’t want to install anything locally.
As it turned out, there was not a huge appetite for that capability.
The fundamental limitations of trying to build on-premises solutions with a cloud-hosted tool unfortunately reduced the audience even further.
BimlOnline maintenance costs have been non-trivial and are competing with the development of more generally useful features in BimlFlex, BimlStudio, and BimlExpress.

**As a consequence, Varigence will be retiring BimlOnline on December 31, 2020.**

Returning to our analogy, despite many contemporary predictions to the contrary, live theatre was not replaced by television.
Instead, the two became distinctly different mediums, each rich and impactful in its own way.
In much the same spirit, users can continue to develop their own data automation solutions using our on-premises BimlFlex, BimlStudio, and BimlExpress tools.
At the same time, our cloud offering will be evolving into something different and better than BimlOnline.
The lessons learned and technologies developed for BimlOnline will find a new home with BimlFlex – both in our metadata management client tool and in our upcoming hosted BimlFlex.com cloud data warehouse automation service.

The future remains bright for data automation in general, and for Biml specifically.
We can’t wait to see what our tools help you to build for your own organizations.
