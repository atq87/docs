# Troubleshooting Tips

When an error occurs in either tool, these tips will help to identify the root cause.

BimlFlex is built on BimlStudio and has a data model dependency on the BimlFlex metadata database.

## Reviewing BimlStudio errors

BimlStudio has an error window that will display all metadata errors and validation issues, errors, and warnings.

Review the error message in the errors list and resolve it to re-populate the entity list.
