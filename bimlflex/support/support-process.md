# Support Process

For Varigence to be able to provide the best possible support for issues encountered while using BimlFlex the following process is recommended.

## Creating a support case

BimlFlex support is provided through a dedicated email address:

[support@bimlflex.com](mailto:support@bimlflex.com)

The BimlFlex Support team will communicate as appropriate to resolve issues. Reply to the ticket email to update the case with any additional information.

## Required information and data in a support case

For Varigence to be able to analyze and provide information for a case the included information needs to be detailed enough so that the context is clear and the steps to reproduce the scenario are available.

To be able to reproduce the issue it is also important that the metadata and any Extension Points files used for the project is provided.

This information can be extracted through either the BimlFlex App or BimlStudio.

In the BimlFlex app, by using the `Export Metadata` feature in the Actions pane.

In BimlStudio, by using the `Debug Utilities` feature in the BimlFlex Ribbon UI.
