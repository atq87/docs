## Get Up To Speed With Data Warehouse Automation 



1. ##### What is a Data Warehouse?

   A data warehouse (DW or DWH), also known as an enterprise **data warehouse** (EDW), is a system used for reporting and **data** analysis, and is considered a core component of business intelligence. DWs are central repositories of integrated **data** from various sources. 

   The important fact is that a transactional database doesn’t lend itself to analytics. To effectively perform analytics, you need a data warehouse. A data warehouse is a database of a different kind: an OLAP (online analytical processing) database. A data warehouse exists as a layer on top of another database or databases (usually OLTP databases). The data warehouse takes the data from all these databases and creates a layer optimized for and dedicated to analytics.

   A database designed to handle transactions isn’t designed to handle analytics. It isn’t structured to do analytics well. A data warehouse, on the other hand, is structured to make analytics fast and easy.

    It serves as corporate memory, collecting the body of history that makes time-series and trend analysis possible.

   The data warehouse also organises and structures data to make it understandable and useful for consumption by many different business stakeholders. This business intelligence gives organisations the edge, making them more competitive, more customer focused, more profitable.

   

2. ##### What is Data Warehouse Automation?

   Data warehouse automation or DWA refers to the process of accelerating and automating the **data warehouse** development cycles, while assuring quality and consistency. 

   Data Warehouse Automation (DWA) is a modern approach to data warehousing. An evolution from traditional ETL, it provides automation and optimizations from designing the warehouse, to generating ETL code, to quickly applying updates, all leveraging best practices and proven design patterns. 

    DWA is the core of devops in the world of analytics, it links together the design and implementation of analytical environments into repeatable processes and should lead to increased data warehouse and data mart quality, as well as decreased time to implement those environments. 

   Data Warehouse Automation describe the automation of the following:

   1. Simplified capture of the Data Warehouse **Design**.
   2. Automated **Build** (i.e. Generate Code)
   3. Automated **Deployment** of code to the Server
   4. Automated **Batch** execution of the ETL code on the Server.
   5. Automated **Monitoring and Reporting** of the Batch execution.

   Generally this is achieved through a [Data Warehouse Automation tool.](http://www.dimodelo.com/) 

   

3. ##### The Evolution of DWA

   In the past, designing a data warehouse has taken too long to complete. Executing numerous semi-automated steps results in a data warehouse that was limited and inflexible. The DWA solution is to automate the data warehouse through every step in the life-cycle, thus reducing the efforts required to manage it.

   The DWA solution comprises a central repository of design patterns, which encapsulate architectural standards as well as best practices for data design, data management, data integration, and data usage. 

   DWA increases developer productivity by automating and accelerating the routine tasks associated with building and managing decision support infrastructures, and gradually improves the time and reduces the repetitive manual efforts associated with each step of a data warehouse lifecycle.  

    A Data Warehouse provides additional benefits over other solutions (i.e. Self Service BI). For example:

   - The ability to keep history,
   - A single source of the truth,
   - End user productivity,
   - Reduced risk of reliance on key individuals,
   - Data augmentation,
   - Query performance etc.

   The problem isn’t the Data Warehouse concept, its still an extremely useful method of managing information. The problem has been execution of Data Warehouse development.

   This is where Data Warehouse Automation comes in. It doesn’t throw out the idea of a Data Warehouse in search of a better way, instead it directly addresses the real problem, being the execution of Data Warehouse development.

   

4. ##### The Limitations of Not Automating

   Today’s data warehouse must meet fast-changing business requirements, support new data sources, and deliver solutions in quick iterations. Traditional ETL tools lack the agility, ease of use and level of automation needed to answer these requirements because they are:

   - **SLOW.** DWA will dramatically reduce your development time.

   - **INFLEXIBLE**:  DWA responds to changing business requirements quickly and easily; it's agile.

   - **BOGGED down in CODE**. DWA allows you to focus on what really matters, reporting and analytics instead of being stuck in ETL code.

   - **OFTEN OUT of DATE**: DWA tools produce tested, high performance, complete and readable code, fast. 

   - **Difficult to STANDARDISE**: DWA produces consistent code, naming standards etc. Developers come and go, but as long as they keep using the same tool, its easy for one developer to understand the work of another.

     So, using DWA your business can make changes much later in the development process and change can occur more frequently with less disruption, waste and rework. This efficiency is not only a joy, it saves time, resources and money. In a traditional data warehouse build, it is especially difficult to get complete and correct requirements due to the linear development process. Automation also brings quality benefits through standards enforcement and standardising the development processes.

     The agility of the automated data warehouse is not limited to its ability to change in the warehouse development process, it can also handle changes in business requirements. Responding to change in real time and without the delay of lengthy projects is the essence of business agility.
