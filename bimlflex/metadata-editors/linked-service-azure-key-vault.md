# Using Azure Key Vaults for Connection settings

ADF linked services allow the use of Azure Key Vault for easy management of linked service settings. We suggest using Azure Key Vault to maintain safe handling of sensitive information. When possible, an Azure Key Vault tab will appear as an alternative to manually filling out connection settings.

## AKV Linked Service

The AKV Linked Service dropdown is used to manage Azure Key Vaults in the BimlFlex application.

BimlFlex can automatically generate a Key Vault for use with the connection. To use the BimlFlex Autogenerated Key Vault, leave the AKV Linked Service dropdown set to "BimlFlex Autogenerated KeyVault" when saving the connection.

To use an existing Key Vault, manually enter the information using the the `AKV Linked Service` dropdown. Expand the dropdown and click `+ New` to enter the Azure Key Vault name and URL. The name entered here will be used to manage the Key Vault in BimlFlex. It does not need to match the Key Vault Secret Name or URL.
