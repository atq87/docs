## Sunburst

The Sunburst Graph gives users a quick graphical overview of their Metadata and provides a convenient way to browse to specific tables from from the dashbaord.

The default view of the Sunburst shows us concentric circles with:
1. `Integration Stages` layer in the center
1. `Connections` layer next layer out from the center
1. `Object Types` the third layer
1. `Objects` outer layer
