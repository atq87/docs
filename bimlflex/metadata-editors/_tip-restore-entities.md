> #### How to Restore an Excluded or Deleted Entity
>
> A deleted or excluded entity can be restored by flipping the appropriate flag back to `false`.  To view a deleted or excluded entity go to your **BimlFlex Options** (1), enable *Show Deleted* and/or *Show Excluded* (2) and click **Apply** (3).  This will allow deleted and/or exlcuded entities to appear.  Please ensure that the option is disabled once the deleted member has been restored.
