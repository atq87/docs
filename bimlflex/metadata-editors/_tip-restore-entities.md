> #### How To Restore An [Excluded] or [Deleted] Entity
>
> A [Deleted] or [Excluded] entity can be restored by flipping the appropriate flag back to `false`.  To view a [Deleted] or [Excluded] entity go to your [BimlFlex Options] (1), enable [Show Deleted] and/or [Show Excluded] (2) and click [Apply] (3).  This will now allow [Deleted] and/or [Exlcuded] entities to appear.  Please ensure that the option is disabled once the deleted member has been restored.
