# Configuring a Linked Service Connection

[//]: # (TODO: Include a summary of Linked Service purpose and use in connections)

Connections can be enabled to work with cloud based linked services.

### Enable Connection for Cloud Services

In the Connections module, click `+ Add` in the top left of the screen or select an existing connection to edit.

![Connections Module Menu -center][connections-module-list]

In the `Details` tab of the connection form, select the `Integration Stage`, `Connection Type`, and `System Type` for your connection. If the configuration provided supports linked service access, a `Cloud` setting will appear in the top right of the connection form.

![Connection Details Tab -center -50%][connections-details-tab]

After toggling the `Cloud` setting, a tab for Linked Services will appear at the bottom of the form and any availble linked services will appear in the `Linked Service Types` dropdown. Select a `Linked Service Type` to configure it.

![Linked Service Dropdown -center -50%][connections-linked-service-dropdown]

### Configuring Linked Service

The linked service form is modeled after the selected `Linked Service Type` and allows for input of all required data points needed to make the linked service connection. This form will maintain the values that are entered if the Linked Service Type is changed.

#### Azure Data Factory Linked Services and Azure Key Vault

ADF linked services allow the use of **Azure Key Vault** for easy management of linked service settings. We suggest using Azure Key Vault to maintain safe handling of sensitive information. When it is allowed, an Azure Key Vault tab will appear as an alternative to manually filling out connection settings.

![Azure Key Vault Form -center -50%][akv]

Connections to Azure Key Vaults are stored in BimlFlex as connections and are listed in the `Connections` tab.

##### AKV Linked Service

Using the the `AKV Linked Service` dropdown new key vaults can be manually entered by clicking `+ New` or automatically generated by selecting `BimlFlex Autogenerated KeyVault`.

##### Secret Name

The Secret Name is the name of your Azure Key Vault. It can also be found in the URL for your Azure Key Vault.

##### Secret Version

The Secret Version is the version of your Azure Key Vault. Use this field to specify the current version or leave this it blank to use the latest.
