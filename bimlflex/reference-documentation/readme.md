# BimlFlex Reference Documentation

This folder contains the static documentation that gets injected into the same destination as the autogenerated contents for the BimlFlex reference documentation. The toc is auto generated by DocFX but the index.md page is the static landing page for users.

Add any required static contents here as md files and they will be included in the site.

yml based toc from generated site contents/metadata seems to be unaware of static contens and yml stitching between conceptual and metadata driven contents seems to be in need of improvement.
