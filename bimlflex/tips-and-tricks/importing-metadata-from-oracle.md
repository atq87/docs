TODO: placeholder for tips and tricks for connecting to and importing from Oracle sources

| Metadata Column | Sample Value |
| --- | --- |
| Connection | Your Connection Name |
| ConnectionString | `TODO: Add sample ConnectionString here` |
| Catalog | Database Name |
| ConnectionType | `OLEDB` |
| SystemType | `Oracle` |
| IntegrationStage | `Source` |
