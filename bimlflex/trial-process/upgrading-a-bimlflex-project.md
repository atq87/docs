## Create and configure the BimlFlex project

The BimlFlex project uses a Bundle file and two databases. These Bundle files and databases are updated as part of the BimlFlex product lifecycle.

Starting the trial project might result in an upgrade dialog being displayed. For the trial process, upgrade the Bundle as well as the databases if a new version is available.

This will ensure that the trial uses the latest features.
