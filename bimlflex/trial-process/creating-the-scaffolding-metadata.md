## Opening the Excel metadata editor

The first time the Excel metadata editor requests data from a newly created customer, it will ask if sample metadata should be created. Creating the sample metadata will create the scaffolding for the trial process.

Scaffolding metadata was created as part of [Creating and Configuring a BimlFlex project](creating-and-configuring-a-bimlflex-project.md). This documentation describes how to recreate it by creating a new customer.

It is also possible to reload metadata from a specific point in the trial process by [using the prepared trial metadata](using-prepared-trial-metadata.md)

## Detailed Steps

The following detailed steps walks through the creation of the BimlFlex scaffolding metadata

### Generating the scaffolding metadata

Either create a new BimlFlex project in BimlStudio or reuse an existing project.

In the Excel metadata editor, click `Create New Customer` to create a new metadata customer in the BimlFlex database.

Click the `Get All Entities` button in the BimlFlex tab in the Excel Metadata editor. Allow BimlFlex to create the sample metadata by clicking the button in the dialog.
