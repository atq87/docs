## BimlFlex

The BimlFlex installation installs the BimlFlex Excel based metadata editor. This is a plugin in to Excel and will be visible as a separate tab in the Excel ribbon when the BimlFlex-enabled Excel workbook is opened from a BimlFlex project.  
When installing it is important to match the Excel bitness version. Verify the Excel bitness version before starting the installation and only install the matching version of BimlFlex.  
There is an option to install custom Ssis components in the BimlFlex installer. As the components have been updated since the installer was released it is not necessary to install them through this process. A separate installer is provided with the custom components
