## Adding Business Data Vault performance constructs

The Point in Time and Bridge table structures are used in Data Vault to make the Data Vault easier to query and to improve query performance.

- Point in Time, PIT, tables are used to create timelines for all changes in all or some Satellites attached to a business entity in a Hub
- Bridge tables are used to link business entities in Hubs through their link tables into easy to query constructs
