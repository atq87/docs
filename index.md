# Support and Documentation

At Varigence, we offer a comprehensive library of professional support resources. We include support within the products, for free to our customers, and as supplemental packages for more extensive training. In addition to the support here we have developed a community at Bimlscript.com where members contribute helpful video tutorials, walkthroughs, and snippets to the community.
