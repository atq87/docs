The Defer Layout Update function allows you to add items to or remove items from the pivot table overlay but defer applying those changes to the pivot table itself. This delays any potential system slow-downs until you are ready to apply the changes to the pivot table. To enable Defer Layout Update, click the Defer Layout Update button. When Defer Layout Update is enabled, you can add, remove, and move items in the pivot table overlay, but the worksheet that the pivot table resides on becomes protected/read-only. If you attempt to change a value in the worksheet, a message appears, reminding you that the worksheet is currently protected/read-only.

To apply your changes to the pivot table, click the Defer Layout Update button again to disable the function.
