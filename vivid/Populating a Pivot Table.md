When you create or load an OLAP pivot table, the Vivid Pivot Table Editor (PTE) appears as a context pane, replacing the standard Excel Pivot Table Field List. The Vivid PTE provides a number of tools to facilitate cube navigation: quick-search boxes that filter lists as you type, a drop-down list enables you to display only attributes or measures of a specific type, expand/collapse all buttons that instantly expand the hierarchy to display all members or collapses it to show only the highest levels, and icons that help you recognize the dimension or measure type of each item listed. You can also enable or disable SmartFilter, the Defer Layout Update function and display or hide the pivot table overlay.

The Pivot Table Overlay appears when you initiate a drag and drop from the PTE or click the Pivot Table Overlay toggle in the bottom right of the PTE.

To populate the pivot table, drag and drop items from the PTE to the Pivot Table Overlay. You can drag and drop measures, calculations, KPI elements, attribute hierarchies, user hierarchies, named sets, and levels to the overlay. Dimensions and measure groups cannot be dragged to the overlay.
