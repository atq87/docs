The Cross Drill function enables you to drill into a specified row or column by a specified attribute.

To perform a cross drill:

1. Right click a row or column label in the pivot table. The selected label is the one that will be cross drilled on.
2. In the context menu, select Cross Drill.
3. Select the dimension and attribute that you wish to appear in the new cross-drilled pivot table.

The result is a new sheet containing a new pivot table. This pivot table is the same as the original pivot table, with the following differences:
- The axis from the label selected to perform the cross drill contains only the attribute selected from the context menu.
- The page filter includes a filter to limit the pivot table to the set of data from the row or column that was right clicked on to perform the cross drill.
