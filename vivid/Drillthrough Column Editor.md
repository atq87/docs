The Drillthrough Column Editor allows you to specify the columns to be returned from a drillthrough to keep these columns in the report. The drillthrough columns are specified on a per-measure-group basis. Whenever there is a drillthrough over a given measure group, the columns that are returned are those that are specified in the Drillthrough Column Editor. If no columns are specified in the Drillthrough Column Editor, then the default set of drillthrough columns is returned for the measure group.

To open the Drillthrough Column Editor, right click on a measure group in the pivot table editor and select _Drillthrough Columns_.
