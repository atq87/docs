Vivid provides a quick and easy method of viewing data in different ways. For example, for total product cost, you might want to see each figure in the column as a percentage of the total product cost instead of a dollar amount.

To view a measure as a percentage or alternative measure:

1. In the pivot table overlay, right click the measure which you want to view differently.
2. Select Show As and then select the alternate measure from the context menu.

###### **The Show As item in the pivot table overlay context menu.**

The figures in the Internet Extended Amount column are now expressed as percentages of the column total.
