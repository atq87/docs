The Hierarchy Descendants feature allows you to navigate rapidly through hierarchies in the pivot table. You can select a level for any given hierarchy, and the pivot table automatically expands or collapses to show the level that you selected.

To perform a Hierarchy Descendants action:

1. Right click on a row or column hierarchy label in a pivot table.
2. Select Hierarchy Descendants from the context menu.
3. Select the level that you want to expand or collapse. The ghosted level in the context menu list of levels is the current level.

If the level selected from the context menu is lower than the current level, then the hierarchy in the pivot table is expanded to the selected level. If the level selected from the context menu is higher than current level, the hierarchy in the pivot table is collapsed up to the selected level.
