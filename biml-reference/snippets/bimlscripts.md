# BimlScripts

Biml is our XML based language for modeling a BI solution. BimlScript allows you to embed C# or VB.NET code into Biml, in the same way that ASP.NET works with HTML.

The BimlScript snippets demonstrate scenarios where BimlScript can solve otherwise cumbersome tasks. To aid in writing your own BimlScripts, check out the [Biml API reference](http://www.varigence.com/documentation/biml/api.html), which documents every property, method, and event available to each .NET class.
