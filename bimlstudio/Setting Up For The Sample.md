To build the sample in this walkthrough, some initial setup is required.

1.  You will need to install the AdventureWorksLT database on your SQL server. This sample database is available on CodePlex. Because the database sample is dependent on your version of SQL Server, you will need to download the appropriate version.

2. Download samples databases from here: [https://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/](https://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/)

3.  You will also need to create a database on your SQL server named AdventureWorksLTDataMart.
