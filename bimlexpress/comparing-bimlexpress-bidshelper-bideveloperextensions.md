# Comparing BimlExpress and BIDS Helper / BI Developer Extensions

Note: In August 2017, BIDS Helper was renamed to [BI Developer Extensions](https://bideveloperextensions.github.io/). You may still see references to BIDS Helper in menus and documentation.

BI Developer Extensions is a free Visual Studio add-in that enhances development functionality in Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) and SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT). It includes the Biml engine, but also includes many other features.

BimlExpress is Varigence's free Visual Studio add-in, created specifically for working on Biml projects. In addition to all the features found in BI Developer Extensions, BimlExpress also provides a full BimlScript code editor with advanced Intelliprompt, support for adding code files from menus, and additional featues can be enabled per product key.
